        Casper Signer is going to be deprecated soon, and new whitelisting requests are no longer accepted.
        
        The [Casper Wallet](https://www.casperwallet.io/) replaces the Casper Signer and offers the same functionalities with more advanced features and up-to-date support.
        
        For new and existing users, and dApp developers looking to integrate signing functionality with their applications, please transition to Casper Wallet.
        
        You can find the necessary developer resources at https://www.casperwallet.io/develop
